### Hello, I'am Mathilde, from France! 👋



I am a Junior FullStack Developer :hatching_chick: but I studied Urban Planning :city_sunset:, gave some French lessons :fr:, finally decided to play chess professionnally during two years ♟️ and suddenly switched to become a Project Manager :pushpin:. 

I am happy to share here my first projects in JS, Handlebars, React and MongoDB, most of them done during my IronHack Bootcamp. :space_invader:

Here is my [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mathilde-congiu/)
